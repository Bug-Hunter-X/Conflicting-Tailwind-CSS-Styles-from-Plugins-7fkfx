# Conflicting Tailwind CSS Styles from Plugins

This repository demonstrates a bug where conflicting styles from different Tailwind CSS plugins or custom configurations cause unexpected rendering issues.  The bug manifests as styles not applying correctly or being overridden unintentionally, leading to inconsistent UI appearance.

## Bug Description

The bug arises when multiple plugins or custom configurations inject styles that target the same CSS selectors. This results in a conflict where one set of styles overrides another, leading to visual inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing plugin order, specificity, and potentially using Tailwind's `@layer` directive to control the order of style application.
